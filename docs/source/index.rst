Welcome to xMARTe Runner Documentation
======================================

This is a minimal set of documentation to show how to install, configure and use the xMARTe runner.

The runners are typically expected to be operated by external applications rather than users so usage is not expected to be operated manually - which is however described in this documentation and can be useful for debugging.

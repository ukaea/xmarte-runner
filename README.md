# xMARTeRunner

This repository provides a server application which will run docker images of the xmarte application for testing and return the recorded data.

It is expected to be used in tandem with other MARTe2 tools, such as [marte2_python](https://github.com/ukaea/MARTe2-python) to execute marte2 configuration files but primarily it compliments the XMARTe GUI and is setup to communicate with the GUI, please see the GUI documentation for details on how to set this up.

The expected usage/user of this software is a application acting as a client user automating several of the tasks and abstracting the usage away from users.

``The server requires docker to be installed as a pre-requisite and the user setting this up to have administrative rights when needed.``

# Installation

The steps to install or upgrade are:

``` bash
curl https://git.ccfe.ac.uk/marte21/public/xmarte-runner/-/raw/master/install.sh?inline=false | sudo bash
```

The steps so far here is simply setting up the directory and the python virtual environment.

`` Note: This repo only support python3.7+ as it depends on uvicorn 0.18 for large header support. ``
